# Dog Breed Explorer

A dynamic and interactive web application for exploring various dog breeds, built with modern front-end technologies. This project showcases the use of multiple public APIs, asynchronous JavaScript for data fetching, and dynamic DOM manipulation to create a seamless user experience.

### ‚ú® Features

*   **Dynamic Breed Dropdown:** On page load, the application fetches a complete list of all dog breeds from the Dog CEO API and populates a searchable dropdown menu.
*   **Image Gallery:** Selecting a breed makes a new API call to fetch a 3x3 grid of high-quality images for that specific breed.
*   **Audio Pronunciation:** Clicking on any dog image in the gallery triggers an API call to a dictionary service to play an audio clip of the breed's name being pronounced.
*   **Favorites System:** Users can "favorite" any dog image. These favorites are saved to the browser's `localStorage`, persisting even after the page is closed.
*   **Animated Background:** A subtle, ambient background animation using Anime.js showcases random dog images on the initial load screen.
